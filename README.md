# Deep-Learning

## 1 : cifar10 with Dense layers.
Use cifar10 from keras datasets
Visualize 10 examples from each class, in a grid of 10x10 plots
Plot a histogram of number of examples per class in the training and test sets
Train and test a model with 3 fully connected layers with the following architecture: 512-256-128


## 2: cifar10 with ConvNets.
Download CIFAR 10 in ipynb
Visualize 10 examples from each class, in a grid of 10x10 plots
Plot a histogram of number of examples per class in the training and test sets
Train and test a ConvNet model as in lec notebook
